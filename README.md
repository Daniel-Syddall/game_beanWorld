This was a project I made back in College for my Graphics Design course. (Link to the Itch.io page is here https://danyle-sidle.itch.io/bean-world)

The idea for the project was to basically re-create the RPG Maker Engine in Python using the Pygame image library (because I loved the style of games made by RPG Maker but refused to use the Engine.) This project was the first real complex project I worked on as it had me working out how to re-create a lot of the complex rendering techniques with the limited functionality of Pygame. If you actually look through some of the versions, you can see that I would get pretty mad at times during development as I really struggled to work around my messy code-base (I am refering to the "Fuck You Update.")

During this project I had only been programming for around a Year so the scripting was a nightmare. Reguardless I am very proud of what I created back then with as little experience I had. 

I can confirm that I have gotten better at coding since this project (it has been 2 years since finishing it). I'll be looking at uploading some of my more recent projects soon enough.
